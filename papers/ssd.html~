The problem motivating this article is the determination of sample size in  clinical 
trials under normal likelihoods and at the substantive testing stage of a 
financial audit where normality is not an appropriate assumption. 
A combination of analytical and simulation based techniques within the 
Bayesian framework is proposed. The  framework accommodates 
two different prior distributions: one is the general purpose fitting prior 
distribution used in Bayesian analysis and the other is the expert subjective 
 prior distribution, the sampling prior which is believed  to generate the parameter values
which in turn generate the data. We obtain many   
theoretical results and one key  result is that 
typical non-informative prior distributions lead to very small 
sample sizes. On the other hand,  a  very informative 
prior distribution may either lead to a very small or a very large sample 
size depending on the location of the centre of the prior distribution and 
the hypothesized value of the parameter. 
The methods developed here are quite general and can be applied 
to other sample size determination (SSD) problems. 
A  number of numerical illustrations which bring out many other 
aspects of the optimum sample size are given.
