Statistical methods are now an essential part of the 
archaeological inference making process. Nowhere is 
this more important than in the analysis and interpretation of 
chronological data, especially when information from 
several sources must be drawn together. Different 
statistical models may, however,  provide 
widely different interpretations of the same data. 
Thus it is often possible to  make conflicting 
re-constructions of archaeological past using different models.  
<p>
Bayesian predictive model choice criteria can be used as 
possible solutions to this problem. A particular advantage 
of Bayesian techniques lies in their ability to compare 
widely different models based on different assumptions 
and prior information. In this paper, we discuss 
recent developments in applying formal model 
choice techniques in archaeological chronology building. 
We illustrate the methods with two examples one each from 
the absolute and the relative chronology building problems.
