<p>
This article develops a new class of distributions 
by introducing skewness in the multivariate elliptically symmetric 
distributions. The class is obtained by using transformation 
and  conditioning. The class contains many standard 
families including the  multivariate skew normal and $t$  
distributions. Analytical forms of the densities are obtained
and distributional properties are studied. 
These developments are followed by practical examples in 
Bayesian regression models. Results on the existence of the posterior 
distributions and moments under improper priors for the regression 
coefficients are obtained.  The methods are illustrated using
practical examples.

Key words:  Bayes factor,  Elliptical  distributions, 
Heavy tailed error distribution, Gibbs sampler, Markov chain Monte Carlo,
Multivariate skewness.
