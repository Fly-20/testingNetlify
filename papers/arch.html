For many years now, archaeologists have postulated that the presence
or absence of various artefact types within excavated features should
give insight as to their relative dates of deposition even when 
stratigraphic information is not present.  A typical
data set used in such studies can be reported as a cross-classification
table (often called an abundance matrix or, equivalently, a contingency table) 
of excavated features against artefact types. Each entry of the table represents 
the number of a particular artefact type found in a particular archaeological 
feature.  Methodologies for attempting to identify temporal sequence on the 
basis of such data are commonly referred to as seriation techniques.

Several different procedures for seriation
including both parametric and  non-parametric statistics have been used in an 
attempt to reconstruct relative chronological orders on the basis of such
contingency tables.  In this paper we develop a number of  possible
model-based approaches that might be used to aid in relative, archaeological
chronology building. We use the recently developed Markov chain Monte 
Carlo method based on Langevin diffusions to fit some of the 
proposed models. Predictive Bayesian model choice techniques 
are then employed to ascertain which of the models we develop are most plausible.
We illustrate our methodology with two examples taken from the literature 
on archaeological seriation.
