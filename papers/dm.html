The Gibbs sampler has proved to be a popular Markovian iterative scheme
for sampling from multi-dimensional distributions, especially for
applications within Bayesian statistics. Despite the existence of its more 
general counterpart, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the Gibbs sampler has
remained the default option for a wide range of problems.
However, the currently available analyses and the convergence assessment 
methods of the Gibbs sampler are neither foolproof nor very powerful.  

<p>

This article  aims to provide a method for approximately
pre-determining convergence properties of the Gibbs sampler. This is to
be done by analysing the convergence properties of the Gibbs sampler
on a normal approximation of the target distribution. In
general, the limiting convergence properties of the Gibbs samplers on a
sequence of target distribution (approaching a limit) are not the same
as the convergence properties of the Gibbs sampler on the limiting
target distribution.  Theoretical results are given in this article to
justify that under conditions, the  convergence properties of the Gibbs
sampler can be approximated as well. A number of practical examples are
given for illustration.
