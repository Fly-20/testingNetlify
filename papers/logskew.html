Often the dependence in multivariate survival data is modeled through 
an individual level effect called the frailty. Due to its mathematical
simplicity the gamma distribution is often used as the frailty 
distribution. However, it is well known that the gamma distribution 
for frailty has many drawbacks. For example, it weakens the effect 
of covariates.  To overcome such drawbacks more heavy tailed 
distributions are  needed to model the appropriate frailty distribution, 
e.g. the positive stable distribution. 
In this paper  we develop a  class of 
log-skew-$t$ distributions for the  frailty.
This class includes the log-normal distribution along
with many other heavy tailed distributions, e.g. log-Cauchy or log-$t$ as
special cases.
The distributions often have heavier tails than the gamma 
and even the positive stable  distributions.

 Conditional on the frailty, the survival times are 
assumed to be independent with proportional hazard structure.
The modeling process is  then completed by assuming an appropriate 
baseline hazard function. There are many prior processes 
for modelling the baseline hazard. An attractive choice 
here is a correlated prior process which offers a great deal 
of flexibility.  We consider such a process  
which jumps according to a time-homogeneous 
Poisson process.  We develop Bayesian methods to obtain posterior 
inference  using a variable dimensional 
Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We illustrate and compare 
our methods using two practical examples.
