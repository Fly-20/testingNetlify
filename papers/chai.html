</center>
<p>


This article generalizes a multivariate skew-elliptical distribution
and describes its many interesting properties. The univariate version of the 
new distribution is compared with two other currently used distributions.
The use of the new distribution is illustrated with a real data example 
suitable for regression modeling. The new model provides a better 
model fit than its two rivals as evaluated by some suitable 
Bayesian model selection criteria.

Keywords: Bayesian inference; Gibbs sampler; kurtosis; skewness;   
skew elliptical distributions.
