</center>
<p>
 In analyzing finite mixture models with an unknown number of components,
standard regularity conditions for consistency are not usually satisfied.
Consistency is then a serious issue, as estimators can exhibit unusual
behavior and actually be inconsistent. A number of methods have been
suggested using the Bayesian approach, but even here consistency is a very
desirable property if such methods are to have a sound theoretical
foundation. In recent work Barron {\it et al.} (1999) give powerful general
conditions under which the posterior distribution in Bayesian analysis is
consistent. These conditions do not cover the case of mixture distributions.
An ideal result would be for consistency to be implied in the mixture case
when the components themselves individually satisfy these conditions. In
this paper we give a general finite parametric
mixture model formulation where this is the case.
