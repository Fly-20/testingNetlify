Short-term forecasts of air-pollution levels in big cities are now 
reported in news papers and other media outlets. Studies indicate that 
even short-term exposure to high levels of an air pollutant called 
atmospheric particulate matter (PM) can lead to long-term health 
effects. Data are typically observed in fixed monitoring stations 
throughout a study region of interest at different time points. Statistical 
spatio-temporal models are appropriate for modeling these data. 
In this article we consider short term forecasting of 
these spatio-temporal processes using a Bayesian Kriged-Kalman 
filtering model. The spatial prediction surface of the model is 
built using the well known method of Kriging for optimum spatial 
prediction and the temporal effects are analyzed using 
the models underlying the Kalman filtering method.
The full Bayesian model is implemented using  MCMC techniques 
which enable us to obtain the optimal Bayesian forecasts in time and space. 
A new cross-validation method based  on the Mahalanobis distance 
between the forecasts and observed data is also developed to asses
the forecasting performance of the implemented model.
