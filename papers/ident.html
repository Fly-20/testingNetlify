 SUMMARY 
 </h4>
</center>
<p>
 
Markov chain Monte Carlo  algorithms are widely used in the fitting of
generalized linear  models (GLM). Such model fitting is somewhat of
an art form requiring suitable trickery and tuning to obtain results one can
have confidence in. A wide range of practical issues arise. The focus here
is on parameter identifiability and posterior propriety. In particular, 
we clarify that  non-identifiability arises for usual GLM's and discuss its
implications for simulation based model fitting. Since often, some part of the prior
specification is vague we consider whether the resulting posterior is
proper, providing rather general and easy to check results for GLM's. We
also show that if a Gibbs sampler is run with an improper posterior, it may
be possible to use the output to obtain meaningful inference for certain
model unknowns.
