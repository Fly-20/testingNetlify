<h2> This book is scheduled to be published in December 2023. Please see the <a href="https://www.foyles.co.uk/book/introduction-to-probability-statistics-and-r/sujit-k-sahu/9783031378645"> publisher's website </a> for further information. 
</h2>

<p>
The book is based on 
<a href="https://www.sujitsahu.com/teach/2020_math1024.pdf">
my lecture notes </a> for a module called Introduction to Probability and Statistics.  

<h2>  Key features of the book: </h2>

<ul>
<li> This is an accessible textbook that engages the reader with many practical examples using probability and statistics for data science and machine learning. 
</li>
<li>The book provides a comprehensive coverage of topics in probability,  and both applied and mathematical statistics.
</li>
<li> The topics discussed in the book cover the syllabus for the 2023 Actuarial Statistics 1 examination administered by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in London.
</li>
<li> R, a popular statistical computing software package,  is introduced from scratch and illustrated with many practical data sets.  
For example, see the <a href="Part1.html"> R Getting Started page</a> or the 
<a href="vignette.html"> the package vignette. </a>   
</li>
<li>The book comes with its own dedicated R package 
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ipsRdbs"> ipsRdbs,</a> available from <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/"> CRAN. </a>  
Once inside R and with the package installed, just asking for help for any data set included in the package  will produce all the code required to reproduce the results and analysis presented in the book for that data set. Hence, a beginner reader can reproduce all those results without having to first learn all the commands and their exact syntax in R. This makes it seamless to learn, use and apply practical methods in introductory probability, statistics and beyond. 

<li>The textbook also contains many theoretical and applied exercises for readers and instructors.
