<h2> Errata </h2> 

Please see the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-37865-2_21?_gl=1*1mu0r25*_up*MQ..&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2a6wBhCVARIsABPeH1vT1jB8a8B-8flWTBxuryQYtkto1SFKqS2SNTzhL8FutIK7z72FYx4aAsTpEALw_wcB"> 
corrections to be made to the R Code </a> published in the printed book. However, please note that 
the  R code lines, published in the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipsRdbs/index.html"> 
CRAN package ipsRdbs,</a> accessed through the help files, are correct 
and will run okay. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. 
<p> 
We regret that there is another typo which appears in the middle of page 370 immediately above the heading of 
Section 17.3.2. The identity in the middile of the three identities should read
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n w_{1i} x_i =1.
$$
The correct value of $\sum_{i=1}^n w_{1i}^2$ has been printed on page 374.
