Chapter 11 discusses techniques such as the pivoting method for interval estimation. The central limit theorem is used to derive confidence intervals for the mean parameters of  binomial, Poisson and normal distributions. For the normal distribution we also discuss the exact confidence interval using the t-distribution without actually deriving the sampling distribution of the t-statistic.
