Finally,  Chapter 19  introduces the concepts of analysis of variance which is a seen as a general model comparison technique where there are categorical explanatory variables. Theoretical generalisation of the techniques from the two preceding chapters are included and so are illustrations using R.  In particular, the one way analysis of variance technique is illustrated by using an ecological example on modelling body weights of brushtail possums â€“ a nocturnal animal  only native to Australia.
