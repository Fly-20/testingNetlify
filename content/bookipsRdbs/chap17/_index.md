Chapter 17 kicks off Part V of the book on  introduction to statistical modelling. It discusses the concepts related to simple regression modelling with many practical examples. The concepts of estimation, inference  and predictions are discussed along with the required theoretical derivations. Simultaneously, illustrations are carried along with  R code so that the reader can immediately transfer their skills into the practical domain.
