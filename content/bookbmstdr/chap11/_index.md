      Parallel to Chapter 8, this chapter showcases four examples of areal and temporal areal unit data sets. The examples are on: 

<ol>
<li> <a href="../Rcode/Chap11_Kenya.html"> Assessing childhood vaccination coverage in Kenya </a>
<li>  <a href="../Rcode/Chap11_USA.html"> Assessing trend in cancer rates in the USA </a>
<li>  <a href="../Rcode/Chap11_eng.html"> Localized modeling of hospitalization data from England </a>
<li> <a href="../Rcode/Chap11_london.html"> Assessing trend in child poverty in London </a>
</ol>
<p>
    All the model fitting  is done using the  <i>Bcartime</i> model fitting function in the  <i>bmstdr</i> package.
The fitted model object is then explored for making several types of inference required
in different practical settings. The full version of the
code lines for model fitting and further investigations   are provided in an online supplement which allows
the reader  to reproduce all the results and graphs illustrated here.
