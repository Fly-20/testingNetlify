This  chapter aims to present GP based models for machine learning showing  an
immediate connection between the GP based regression models presented in the
earlier chapters. The chapter highlights the  equivalent
correspondences between the different terminologies used in the fields of mainstream statistics and data science.
For example, estimation (and prediction)  is generically termed as `learning' in data science.
The chapter  further elaborates and use these synergies to build bridges between the two fields - more importantly between
what has been presented in the earlier chapters of this book and relevant parts of machine learning. 
The chapter also discusses the use  of GP in Bayesian calibration of computer codes.
