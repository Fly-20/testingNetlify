 Presented in a stand alone fashion,  this chapter describes the
main ideas of Bayesian inference needed in the rest of the book. Starting from the Bayes theorem in
probability it discusses prior and posterior distributions, point and interval estimation, prior and
posterior predictive distribution for model checking, hypothesis testing and Bayesian  model choice statistics
such as the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC) and  Watanabe Information Criteria (WAIC).
<p>
A simple conjugate normal-normal example is used to illustrate the methods and  interpretations of,
and the background intuition behind,  the results. All mathematical derivations are included and the
level of mathematical difficulty is suitable for a final year
undergraduate student majoring in mathematics/statistics or a post-graduate student with some background in
these or a related subject. Theoretical exercises are provided to check understanding. However, it is not necessary to learn all
the derivations to understand the modeling presented in the subsequent chapters as commentary has been provided to
interpret the results from a practical view point.
