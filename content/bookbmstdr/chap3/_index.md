<p> 
	This chapter emphasizes the need to carry out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) before embarking on any modeling
endeavor. EDA techniques introduced include non-spatial techniques such as histogram, pairwise scatter plots;
spatial methods such as variogram and Kriging; and temporal exploration such as time series plots.  
  In particular, the chapter  explores the following four data sets which are provided in the <i>bmstdr </i> package.
  <ol>
 <li> <i> nyspatial </i>:  point referenced spatial air pollution data from New York, 
<li>  <i> nysptime:</i>  point referenced spatio-temporal air pollution data from New York, 
<li> <i>engtotals:</i> areal unit data on Covid-19 mortality in England,
<li> <i> engdeaths:</i> areal unit weekly temporal data on Covid-19 mortality in England, 
</ol>
  Familiarity of these data sets is crucial for understanding the modeling performed in the  later chapters.
