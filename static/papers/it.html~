Item response models are essential tools for analyzing results from
many placement tests.  Such models are used to quantify the
probability of correct response as a function of unobserved examinee
ability and other parameters explaining the difficulty and the
discriminatory power of the questions in the test. Some of
these models also incorporate a threshold parameter for the
probability of the correct response to eliminate the effect of
guessing the correct answer in multiple choice type tests.

In this article we consider fitting of these models using
the Gibbs sampler.  A data augmentation method to analyze a
normal-ogive model incorporating a threshold guessing  parameter
is introduced. A more important objective of this
paper is to develop Bayesian model choice techniques for model
discrimination. A predictive approach based on a variant of the Bayes
factor is used and compared with another decision theoretic method which
minimizes an expected loss function on the predictive space. A
classical model choice technique based on a modified likelihood ratio
test statistic is shown as one component of the second criterion.  As
a consequence the Bayesian methods proposed in this paper are
contrasted with the classical approach based on the likelihood ratio
test.  Two practical examples are given to illustrate the methods.
