There is an urgent need to provide accurate air quality information 
and forecasts to the general public and environmental health 
decision-makers.  This paper develops a  hierarchical space-time 
model for daily 8-hour maximum ozone concentration (O$_3$)  
data covering much of the eastern United States. The model 
combines observed data and forecast output from a 
computer simulation model known as the Eta 
Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ)  forecast model in a 
very flexible, yet computationally fast way, so that the next day 
forecasts can be computed in real-time operational mode. The model 
adjusts for spatio-temporal biases in the Eta CMAQ forecasts 
and avoids a change of  support problem often encountered 
in data fusion settings where real data have been observed 
at point level monitoring sites, but the forecasts from the computer model
are provided at grid cell levels. 
The model is validated with a large amount of set-aside 
data and is shown to provide much improved forecasts of  daily O$_3$
concentrations in the Eastern United States.
