<p>

Recent successful developments in Bayesian modeling and computation for 
large and complex data sets have led to a step change in the analysis of 
space-time air pollution data. 
Accurate predictions and inferences, 
as a result of joint modeling of spatial and temporal dependence, 
are being made even for summaries and aggregates in time and/or space. 
Modelers are increasingly benefiting by their ability to reducing 
uncertainty in the inference statements for the aggregates, in addition,  
by combining information from several sources in a hierarchical Bayesian 
framework.  The information sources may include actual observed data from 
several heterogeneous monitoring networks,  outputs of community numerical models, 
meteorological observations, land use surfaces and power station emission volumes. 
The best statistical model for the particular problem at hand recognizes the 
relative contribution of the available sources and decides on their optimum role in it.      
In this chapter we develop a  hierarchical auto-regressive Bayesian model for 
space-time air pollution data and illustrate the benefits of modeling  with a 
real data example on monitoring ozone pollution.
We report substantial gains in predictive mean square error for the proposed  
model over some other currently available competing modeling methods.
