<p>


A  Bayesian hierarchical space-time model is proposed 
by combining information  from real-time ambient AIRNow 
air monitoring data,  and output from a computer simulation 
model known as the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (Eta-CMAQ) 
forecast model. A model validation analysis shows that the 
interpolated maps are more accurate 
than the maps based solely on the Eta-CMAQ forecast data for a two 
week test period.  The out-of sample spatial 
predictions and temporal forecasts also outperform those from
regression models with  independent Gaussian errors. 
The method is fully Bayesian and is able to 
instantly update the map for the current hour (upon receiving monitor 
data for the current hour) and forecast the map for several hours ahead.
In particular, the eight-hour average map which is  the average of the  
past four hours, current hour and three hours ahead is 
instantly obtained at the current hour.  
The exact Bayesian  method proposed here is preferable to more complex 
(possibly more accurate) models since iterative methods 
such as the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are not required to obtain the 
fitting and forecasting results.
