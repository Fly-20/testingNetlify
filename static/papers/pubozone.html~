The assessment of air pollution regulatory programs designed to 
improve ground level ozone concentrations is a topic of considerable
interest to environmental managers. To aid this assessment, it is 
necessary to model the space-time behavior of ozone for predicting 
summaries of ozone across spatial domains of interest and for the 
detection of long-term trends at monitoring sites. 
These trends, adjusted for the effects of meteorological variables, 
are needed for determining the effectiveness of pollution control
programs in terms of their magnitude and uncertainties across space. 
This paper proposes a space-time model for daily 8-hour maximum ozone 
levels to provide input to regulatory activities: detection, evaluation, 
and analysis of spatial patterns of ozone summaries and temporal trends. 
The model is   applied to analyzing data from the    
state of Ohio which has been chosen because it
contains a mix of urban, suburban, and rural ozone monitoring sites 
in several large cities separated by large rural areas. 
The proposed space-time model is auto-regressive and incorporates 
the most important meteorological variables observed at a collection of 
ozone monitoring sites as well as at several weather stations where 
ozone levels have not been observed. This problem of misalignment 
of ozone and meteorological data is overcome by spatial modeling of the latter. 
In so doing we adopt an approach based on the successive daily increments in
meteorological variables. With regard to modeling, the increment (or
change-in-meteorology) process proves more attractive than working
directly with the meteorology process, without sacrificing any
desired inference. The full model is specified within a Bayesian
framework and is fitted using MCMC techniques. Hence, full inference
with regard to model unknowns is available as well as for
predictions in time and space, evaluation of annual summaries and 
assessment of trends.
