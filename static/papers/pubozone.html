This paper proposes a space-time model for daily 8-hour maximum
ozone levels to provide input for regulatory activities: detection,
evaluation, and analysis of spatial patterns and temporal trend in
ozone summaries.  The model is   applied to the analysis of data
from the state of Ohio which contains a mix of urban, suburban, and
rural ozone monitoring sites. The proposed space-time model is
auto-regressive and incorporates the most important meteorological
variables observed at a collection of ozone monitoring sites as well
as at several weather stations where ozone levels have not been
observed. This misalignment is handled through spatial modeling. In
so doing we adopt a computationally convenient approach based on the
successive daily increments in meteorological variables.  The
resulting hierarchical model is specified within a Bayesian
framework and is fitted using MCMC techniques. Full inference with
regard to model unknowns as well as for predictions in time and
space, evaluation of annual summaries and assessment of trends are
presented.
