<p>

This article proposes a new method of construction of Markov
chains with a given stationary distribution. The method is based
on constructing an auxiliary chain  with some other stationary
distribution and picking elements of this auxiliary chain  a
suitable number of times. The proposed method is easy to implement
and analyze; it could be more efficient than some related MCMC
techniques. The main attractive feature of the associated Markov
chain is that it regenerates whenever it accepts a new proposed
point. This makes the algorithm easy to adapt and tune for
difficult problems.  Theoretical study and numerical comparisons
with some other available MCMC techniques are made.
