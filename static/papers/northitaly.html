Statistical methods are needed  for evaluating many aspects of air pollution 
regulations increasingly adopted by many  different governments in the 
European Union.  The  atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is an important 
air pollutant  for which regulations have been issued recently. A 
challenging task here is to evaluate the regulations based on data 
monitored on a heterogeneous network where PM has been 
observed at a number of sites and a surrogate has been observed 
at some other sites. This paper develops a  hierarchical Bayesian
joint space-time model 
for the PM measurements and its surrogate between which the 
exact relationship is unknown, and applies the methods  to analyse
spatio-temporal data obtained from a number of  sites in north Italy.  
The model is implemented 
using MCMC techniques and methods are developed to meet the 
regulatory demands. These enable full inference with regard to 
process unknowns, calibration, validation,   
predictions in time and space, and evaluation of regulatory standards.
