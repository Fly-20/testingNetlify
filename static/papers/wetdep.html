Motivated by the problem of predicting chemical deposition in the eastern United States at weekly, seasonal, and annual
scales, this paper develops a framework for joint modeling of point and grid referenced spatio-temporal data in this
context. The proposed hierarchical model is able to provide accurate spatial interpolation and temporal aggregation  by
combining information from observed point referenced monitoring data and gridded output from a numerical simulation model
known as the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The technique avoids the change of support problem which arises
in other hierarchical models for data fusion settings to combine point and grid referenced data. The hierarchical space-time
model is fitted to weekly wet sulfate and nitrate deposition data over the eastern United States. The model is validated
with set-aside data from a number of monitoring sites. Predictive Bayesian methods are developed and illustrated for
inference on aggregated summaries such as quarterly and annual deposition maps.
