<p>
A suitable model for analyzing rainfall data needs to take
into account variation in both space and time. The method of
kriging is a popular approach in spatial statistics which makes
predictions for spatial data. Kalman filtering using dynamic
models is often used to analyze temporal data. These
approaches have been combined  in a classical framework termed kriged
Kalman filter (KKF) model. In the combined model, the kriging
predictions dictate the optimal regression surface for
incorporating spatial structure and the dynamic linear model
framework is used to learn about temporal factors such as trends,
autoregressive components and cyclical variations.
In this article we consider a full Bayesian KKF (BKKF) model for rainfall data
and its MCMC implementation.   The
MCMC techniques provide unified estimation of spatio-temporal
effects and allow optimal predictions in time and space.
The methods are illustrated with two real data examples.
Using many well known validation methods we highlight the advantages of the BKKF model.
