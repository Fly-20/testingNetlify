<p>
In response to the drought experienced in Southern Italy a rain
seeding project has been setup and developed during the years 1989--1994.
The initiative was taken with the purpose of
applying existing methods of rain enhancement technology  to
regions of south Italy including Puglia.
The aim of this paper is to provide statistical support for
the evaluation of the experimental part of the  project.
In particular our aim is to reconstruct
rainfall fields by combining two data sources: rainfall intensity as
measured by ground raingauges and radar reflectivity.
<p>
A difficulty in modeling the rainfall data here comes from
rounding of many recorded rainguages. The rounding of the rainfall
measurements make the data essentially discrete and models based
on continuous distributions are not  suitable  for
modeling these discrete data. In this  paper we extend
two recently developed spatio-temporal models for continuous 
data to accommodate rounded rainfall 
measurements taking discrete values with positive probabilities.  We use
MCMC methods to implement the models and obtain forecasts in space
and time together with their standard errors. We  compare the two
models using predictive Bayesian methods. The benefits of our
modeling extensions are seen in accurate predictions of dry
periods with no positive prediction standard errors.
