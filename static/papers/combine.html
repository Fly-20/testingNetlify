In the environmental exposure community numerical models are now widely available for a number of air pollutants. These
models provide output exposures at various spatial and temporal resolutions.  They are based on inputs from a number factors
such as meteorological conditions, land usage, and power station emission volumes, all of which are responsible for
producing air pollution. Prediction of spatial surfaces may be available for current, past, and future time periods. For
large spatial regions such as the entire United States, the spatial coverage of the available network of fixed monitoring
stations can never match the coverage at which the computer models produce their output. However, the monitoring data will
be more accurate than the computer model output since, up to measurement error, they provide the actual true levels; at each
time point, they are a finite set of observations from the  realization of the pollution process surface at that time. The
latter typically require calibration.  In any event, it seems natural to attempt to combine these two sets of information to
make inference regarding the pollution exposure. In this chapter we review the currently available fully model-based methods
in the literature and illustrate a novel, very recent, method with a real data example.
