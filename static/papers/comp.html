Multivariate survival data arise when each study subject may experience
multiple events or when the study involves several members of each group.
Statistical analyses of such data need to account for the intra-cluster
dependence through appropriate modeling. Frailty models are the most popular
for such failure time data. However, there are other approaches which model
the dependence structure directly. In this article, we compare the frailty
models for bivariate data with the models based on bivariate exponential
and Weibull distributions. Bayesian methods provide a convenient paradigm
for comparing the two sets of models we consider.
Our techniques  are illustrated using two examples.
One simulated example demonstrates model choice methods
developed in this paper and the other example, based on a practical
data set of onset of blindness for diabetic Retinopathy patients,
considers Bayesian inference using different models.
