   Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Bayesian space-time modeling of daily maximum
eight-hour average ozone concentration levels.  Hierarchical models based on well known 
time series modeling methods such as the dynamic linear models (DLM) and  
the  auto-regressive (AR) models are often used in the literature. 
The DLM, developed as a result of the popularity of 
Kalman filtering methods, provide a dynamical state-space system that is thought to evolve from 
a pair of state and observation equations. The AR models, on the other hand, 
cast in a Bayesian hierarchical setting, have recently been developed through  a pair of models where a 
measurement error model is formulated  at the top level and an AR model for the true
ozone concentration levels is postulated at the next level. Each of the modeling scenarios is set in 
an appropriate multivariate setting to model the spatial dependence.     
This paper compares these two methods in hierarchical Bayesian settings. 
A  simplified skeletal version of the DLM taken from Dou {\it et al.} (2009) is compared 
theoretically with a matching hierarchical AR model. The comparisons reveal 
many important differences in the induced space-time correlation structures. 
Further comparisons of the variances of the predictive distributions by conditioning 
on different sets of data for each model show superior performances of the AR models under 
certain conditions. These  theoretical investigations are followed-up by 
a simulation study  and a real data example implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods for modeling daily maximum eight-hour average  ozone concentration levels
observed in the state of New York in the months of July and August, 2006. 
The hierarchical AR  model is chosen by all the model choice criteria 
considered in this example.
