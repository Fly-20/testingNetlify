Studies indicate that even short-term exposure to high
concentrations of fine atmospheric particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$)
can lead to long-term health effects. In this paper, we propose a
random effects model for PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations. In particular,
we anticipate urban/rural differences with regard to both mean
levels and variability.  Hence we introduce two random
 effects components, one for rural or background levels
and the other  as a supplement for urban areas.  These are
specified in the form of spatio-temporal processes.  Weighting
these processes through a population density surface results in
nonstationarity in space.
We analyze daily PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations in
three Midwestern U.S. states  for the year 2001.
A fully  Bayesian model is implemented, using  MCMC
techniques, which enables full inference with regard to process
unknowns as well as predictions in time and space.
