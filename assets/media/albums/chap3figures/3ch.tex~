Typical areal data are represented by a {\it choropleth map}
which uses shades of color or grey scale to classify values 
into a few broad classes, like a histogram. Such a map provides 
adjacency information of the areal units (blocks or regions). 
Some statistical issues here are spatio-temporal smoothing,   
inference and predictions for new areal units. 
Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF) and conditional auto-regressive (CAR) 
models  are appropriate here. See, for example Besag {\it et al.} (1991) 
and the book by 
Rue and Held (2005) and the references therein for more details and 
many related applications. 


Recently there has been a particular interest in the joint spatial
analysis of area-specific rates of several potentially related diseases, 
see for example, Gelfand and Vounatsou (2003),  Held {\it et al.}  (2005),  
Hogan and Tchernis (2004),  Knorr-Held and Best (2001), 
 Knorr-Held (2000), Schmid and Held (2004), 
 Sun {\it et al.} (2000)
and  Wang and Wall (2003). The purpose here is to detect 
common spatial patterns in the underlying disease-specific risk surfaces. 
Models have either been based on a multivariate extension of the widely 
used CAR model or on spatial generalizations of a factor analysis type model. 
Best and Tzala (2005) extend the factor analysis approach to consider the 
joint analysis of spatial-temporal variations in area-specific rates of 
several diseases over time. They adopt a Bayesian hierarchical modeling 
framework, and consider various prior formulations for the
latent spatial and temporal factors reflecting the shared pattern of risk. The model
is motivated by an analysis of age standardized annual mortality rates of 17 cancer
sites across the 51 administrative districts in Greece for the years 1981 to 1999.



The ideas behind the spatio-temporal modeling can be broadly
cross-classified according to: (a) their motivation, (b) their 
underlying objectives and (c) the scale of data.  
Under (a) the motivations for models can be classified into four
classes: (i) extensions of time series methods to space (ii) extension
of random field and imaging techniques to time (iii) interaction of
time and space methods and (iv) physical models.  Under (b) the main
objectives can be viewed as either data reduction or prediction.
Finally, under (c) the available data might be sparse or dense in time
or space respectively, and the modeling approach often takes this
scale of data into account.  In addition, the data can be either
continuously-indexed or discretely-indexed in space and/or time.
Based on these considerations, especially (i) -- (iii), 
statistical model building and their implementation  take place. 

In order to model spatio-temporal data there is an obvious need to keep 
track of the spatial location, denoted by $\bolds$ in a region $D$ say,  
and the time point, $t \in \R$ of an observation, say $Z(\bolds, t)$. 
There may be additional covariate information available which we denote 
by $\boldx(\bolds, t)$. Different data types arise by the ways in which  
the points $\bolds$ are observed in $D$. 

Typical {\it point reference data} arise when $\bolds$ varies 
continuously over a fixed study region $D$. For example, we may have observed 
the response $Z(\bolds, t)$ and the covariates at a set of $n$ locations denoted 
by  $\bolds_i$, $i=1, \ldots, n$ and at $T$ time points so that $t=1, \ldots, T$.
The set of spatial locations can either be fixed monitoring stations, 
like in an air pollution example,  or can vary with time  for example
data obtained from  a research ship measuring ocean characteristics 
as it moves about in the ocean. We shall discuss modeling these type of data in 
some detail in Section~??. We discuss two other important and 
often used data types in Sections~??~and~??
before discussing models for point reference data in  Section~??.
